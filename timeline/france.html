                        <p>I’ve been in the south of France for a week now.</p>

                        <p>Eating healthy in France is a lot cheaper than in the UK.</p>

                        <p>Sweets are almost triple the price they are in the UK.</p>

                        <p>French people prefer cash over card.</p>

                        <p>They drive on the other side of the road here so it gets weird at roundabouts.</p>

                        <h3>19th December 2020</h3>

                        <p>The french lockdown finished a few days ago and I went to Toulouse, the fourth largest city in France.</p>

                        <p>I only had a few hours in Toulouse, but I was able to look around some shops and get some food.
                        </p>

                        <p>My French is getting better. I’m at the point now where I can have some blunt conversations and get around. Duolingo works but it's not great for real talk with french people.</p>

                        <p>The masks mean I can't smile smile anymore. Human interaction is a shell of what it used to be at the moment, but it can't last forever ? ? ? </p>

                        <p>Because of the masks I’m not able to lip read or fully hear conversations. I’m sure it’s pretty awful for anybody trying to learn a language. and deaf people.</p>

                        <p>Maybe deaf people would be grateful if everyone learned some sign language.</p>

                        <p>Usually if I’m struggling in Français, I’ll pull out the <i>Désolé, je parle petit Français.</i></p>

                        <p>Most of the time the person I’m speaking to would give me a hand in French or understand and we could laugh together.</p>

                        <p>It was still amazing to see thousands of people walking through the streets of Toulouse. I hadn’t seen this many people together since February. That's a whole 10 months of no big crowds.</p>

                        <h3>12th January 2021</h3>

                        <p>I've been in France for over a month now.</p>

                        <p>France is very local compared to England. Vegetables and fruit are grown in the local area, to be distributed locally. The people here are consuming mostly local produce which must be economically a lot better than having it flown half way across the world.</p>

                        <p>The French love to be self sufficient. Lots of livestock about. Even in the villages, people seem to have their own chickens and vegetable patches.</p>

                        <p>Each village has an elected mayor, who the village people can speak to directly.</p>

                        <p>Shops shut at lunch for a couple of hours, which gives everyone the chance to go home and get some food, have some family time and recharge as well.</p>

                    </div>

                        <h3>2nd February 2021</h3>

                        <p>Returned to Toulouse for a couple of days and checked the city out properly. Time wasn’t an issue now, so I could do some real city stomping. </p>

                        <p>While walking about I stumbled across the <b>Basilica of Saint-Sernin</b>, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It was also open for the public to visit!</p>

                    </div>

                    <br>

                    <div>

                        <h3>11th February 2021</h3>

                        <p>Began feeling like I'd abandoned England a few days ago so I booked the ferry home. Brexit happened, and since then it feels like England is getting worse.</p>

                        <p>It looks like as a country we made the wrong decision, but only time will tell. I wasn't old enough to have my say in the Brexit vote but it's going to be my generation and the people younger than me who properly deals with the consequences.</p>
